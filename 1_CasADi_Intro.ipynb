    "* Go through the topics introduced in [CasADi Docs](https://web.casadi.org/docs/) (which is written more like a tutorial rather than code documentation), skipping any topics that are directly not relevant to trajectory optimization via direct collocation.\n",
    "* Introduce an example of a Nonlinear Program (NLP) solved through the CasADi opti stack, and comparing it with with the \"raw\" NLP interface for CasADi.\n",
    "* It is still recommended that you read the references, at least Sec. 3 and 4 of CasADi Docs to get a better description of each data structure. The purpose of this notebook is to supplement it through interactive implementations and to offer my own practical advice using this library, to hopefully accelerate the learning process for someone with numpy experience.\n",
